# Mapping Inequity: Travel Time Barriers to Health Care in Peru and Implications for Universal Health Coverage
## Contents

The Biostatistics team at the University of Engineering and Technology (UTEC) developed this project to provide policy-makers, researchers and the public with timely, accurate and openly accessible geospatial data on travel times to health care facilities across Peru. Using least-cost path modelling, we produce downloadable datasets of travel times to Level I, II and III facilities, accompanied by R scripts for reproduction and analysis.
